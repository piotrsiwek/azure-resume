# azure-resume
My Azure project based on ACG video.

I have integrated my resume into GitHub and hosted it on Microsoft Azure using Blob Storage, Azure Functions and CosmosDB. The resume is generated dynamically based on the data stored in CosmosDB using Azure Functions and served through a simple web page hosted on Blob Storage. This allows me to keep my resume up-to-date and easily accessible.
